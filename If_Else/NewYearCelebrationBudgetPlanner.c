/*
This New Year, Sharib (an experienced event planner) is planning a celebration and needs your help to determine if they can host it within their budget. Sharib has a list of expenses for different activities and items, along with specific conditions for hosting the celebration. Write a program to evaluate whether Sharib can host the celebration or not.

Conditions to Host the Celebration:

The total cost of the celebration must not exceed the budget.
The number of guests must be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 50.
At least one of the following conditions must hold:
The decoration cost is less than 30% of the budget.
The total food cost is less than 50% of the budget.
If the number of guests exceeds 25, there must be a music arrangement (i.e., musicCost > 0).
Input Format

The input consists of six integers:

budget: Total budget for the celebration (in dollars).
numGuests: Number of guests invited.
foodCostPerGuest: Cost of food per guest (in dollars).
decorationCost: Cost of decorations (in dollars).
musicCost: Cost of hiring a DJ or music system (in dollars).
extraExpenses: Additional expenses for the celebration (in dollars).
Constraints

1 ≤ budget ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ numGuests ≤ 100
1 ≤ foodCostPerGuest ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ decorationCost ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ musicCost ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ extraExpenses ≤ 10^4
Output Format

Output a single line:

"Celebration Approved" if Sharib can host the celebration within the given conditions.
"Celebration Denied" otherwise.
